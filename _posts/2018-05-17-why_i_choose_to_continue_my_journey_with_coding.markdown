Let me start by saying I grew up with computers virtually from birth. My dad owed a computer consulting business so one of the first questions I can remeber asking as a child was "What is a floppy disk used for", however when I was 11 years old, I discovered a whole new universe on my computer. From the moment I jumped off the school bus each day . my journey on the world-wide web would begin. Now, for background information you should know this was fall 2006 and laptops weren't as widely used as they are now, so I basically commendeered my family desktop for around 6 hours a day. Since I wasn't allowed to have a MySpace I found another website called "My Buddy List", where I quickly realized was very easy to manipulate the layout of my page. From there I began serching the web to add cool features to my page, this is how I discovered code. After finding something I wanted to add or change to my page, I would rewrite the code to my liking and then *voila* a super cool pimped out "buddy page" would appear. 

Fast forward to high school, I had lost all desire to participate in technology classes when realizing I was always the only girl. I cheered and took art and cooking classes electives instead, but little did anyone know, I was still enhancing my skills by *living* on Tumblr buring the wee hours of the night. 

Now, its May 2018. I am six months out of college and rediscovering my love for coding once again. This is my story...
