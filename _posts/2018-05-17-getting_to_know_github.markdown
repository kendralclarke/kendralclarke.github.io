Although I heard of it many times before, to me GitHub was just some techy website that me as an ammature programmer would never understand. Little did I know, it opens the world to everything that I could ever want and need of a hosting service. 

At first, I didn't quite understand the point, but I know realize that its a great way for anyone to document and save their code to share with others. Even though I am just starting to document mycoding  journey, I couldn't be more excited to see what other programmers have wrote and start sharing my work with the global community!
