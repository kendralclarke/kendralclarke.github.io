<p>Kendra Clarke is a recent graduate with a degree in Public Relations from St. John's University. After working with various tech companies including Uber and StreetEasy (Zillow Group), she realized her passion for web development became a desire to pursue a more in depth understanding of front-end development. In her off time you can most likely find her in a yoga studio or enjoying the great outdoors...that is if she's not binge watching her latest obsession on Netflix or diving into a book.  * Fun Facts*-Kendra taught herself HTML at the age of 11 and her favorite super hero is Shuri from Black Panther. </p>
